## Subsoverlay is... 
...a website created solely to test out overlaying softsubs on official donghua releases, and it should be painfully obvious that <b><i>I have literally zero experience in web design and coding</i></b>. Everything you see here is achieved through intense googling and the immense help of several donghua and non-donghua loving friends. While it is created <b>for Guodong Subs</b>, it is not explicitly named as such because: 
 
* www.guodongsubs.com will be reinstated once we purchase a newer (and smaller) server, 

* before I secure a way to embed official Tencent and Bilibili links, I would still need to use third-party raws and Guodong is actively moving away from that, and 

* most if not all edits I make to the code here is trial and error and could crash the whole site anytime 

As of 23 June 2021, there is still **no way to inject Tencent and Bilibili official videos to Videojs** and subsequently Videojsass. Tencent retricts all external sites embeds to play only the first 3 minutes, and all Bilibili embeds are capped at 480p max. The only method to overlay softsubs on those right now is via chrome plugins: AssLoader by @regsvr32 (for full typeset) and any other subtitles loading extensions such as Substital or +Sub (srt only), all of them available on the Chrome Web Store. You may simply visit the official Tencent/Bilibili sites and watch the official episode with any one of those plugins. They will work, albeit still a buggy workaround. In some cases, we will pair our softsubs with raws provided by third parties, mainly GMTeam, until the official release makes to Youtube, **at which I will just replace the video source with the official source.**

I am indebted to @bugkkura for the inspiration and also for graciously sharing her code. Without her this project would not have been possible.
