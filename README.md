SubsOverlay is a website created solely to test out overlaying softsubs on official donghua releases, and it should be painfully obvious that ***I have literally zero experience on web design and coding***. Everything you see here is achieved through intense googling and the immense help of several donghua and non-donghua loving friends. While it is created **for Guodong Subs**, it is not explicitly named as such because: 

1) guodongsubs.com will be resurrected once we purchase a newer (and smaller) server, 

2) before I secure a way to embed official Tencent and Bilibili links, I would still need to use third-party raws and Guodong is actively moving away from that, and 

3) most if not all edits I make to the code here is trial and error and could crash the whole site anytime. 

I am also at the final semester of my university; I can only commit a certain number of hours per week to manage the site on top of studies and proofreading and translating. 

As of 23 June 2021, there is still **no way to inject Tencent and Bilibili official videos** to Videojs and subsequently Videojsass. Tencent retricts all external sites embeds **to play only the first 3 minutes**, all Bilibili embeds are **capped at 480p max**. The only method to overlay softsubs on those right now is via chrome plugins, AssLoader by @regsvr32 (for full typeset) and any other subtitles loading extensions such as Substital or +Sub (srt only), all of them available on the Chrome Web Store. You may simply visit the official sites and use any one of those plugins. They will work, albeit still an imperfect workaround. Otherwise, I will be pairing our softsubs with raws provided by third parties, mainly GMTeam, until the official release makes to Youtube, at which I will replace the video source to the official source.  

I am indebted to @bugkkura for the inspiration and also for graciously sharing her code. Without her this project would not have been possible.
